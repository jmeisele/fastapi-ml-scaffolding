# FastAPI Model Server Scaffolding

Serving machine learning models production-ready, fast, easy and secure powered by FastAPI by [Sebastián Ramírez](https://github.com/tiangolo).

This repository contains a starter app which can be used to speed-up your next machine learning project.

To experiment and get a feeling on how to use this scaffolding, a sample regression model for house price prediction is included in this project. Follow the installation and setup instructions to run the sample model and serve it aso RESTful API.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+

## Installation/Setup

Makefile provided to get you up and going quickly.

```bash
make setup
```

## Run It

1. Start your app with:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app
```

2. Go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
3. You can use the sample payload from the `docs/sample_payload.json` file when trying out the house price prediction model using the API.
